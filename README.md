# gHoodies
Simple Full stack application built as a side project over a weekend to allow Galvanize students to submit sizing information for Galvanize Hoodies.  The back end of this project was built using Node/Express with a PostgreSQL database and Knex.js query builder.  The front end of the project was built using HTML, CSS (Materialize CSS Framework) and jQuery.  

We did manage to get the entire class hoodies as a result of the effort.
